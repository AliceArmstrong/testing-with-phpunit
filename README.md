# testing-with-phpunit
WIP repo for teaching people how to test. This series of workshops is being created with Laravel in mind, and thus contains some Laravel functionality, but the majority of it is purely PHPUnit.

1. Intro to testing
2. Doubles: Mocks, stubs and prophecy
5. Advanced techniques
6. Refresher

To add PHPUnit into your own project, start with these steps:

Quick-start for PHP 7.3 or later:
